1. Fully specify outcome domains. & For each outcome domain, provide a short label (e.g. cognition, consumer evaluation of care) and describe the domain in sufficient detail to enable eligible outcomes from each included study to be categorized. The definition should be based on the concept (or construct) measured, that is “what” is measured. ‘When’ and ‘how’ the outcome is measured will be considered in subsequent steps. & In a review of computer-based interventions for sexual health promotion, three broad outcome domains were defined (cognitions, behaviours, biological) based on a conceptual model of how the intervention might work. Each domain comprised more specific domains and outcomes (e.g, condom use, seeing health services such as STI testing), listing these helped define the broad domains and guided categorization of the diverse outcomes reported in included studies (Bailey et al., 2010). & In a protocol for a review of social media interventions for improving health, the rationale for synthesizing broad groupings of outcomes (e.g, health behaviors, physical health) was based on prediction of a common underlying mechanism by which the intervention would work, and the review objective, which focused on overall health rather than specific outcomes (Wich et al., 2018). & In a protocol for a review of social media interventions for improving health, the rationale for synthesizing broad groupings of outcomes

path or logic model may help identify logical groupings of related outcomes for reporting and analysis, and alternative levels at which to synthesize.

2. Determine whether there is an existing system for identifying and grouping important outcomes.

Systems for categorizing outcomes include core outcome sets including the COMET and LHOM initiatives, and outcome taxonomies (Dodd et al., 2018). These systems define agreed outcomes that should be measured for specific conditions (Williamson et al., 2017). These systems can be used to standardize the varied outcome labels used across studies and enable grouping and comparison (Ridkham et al., 2013). Agreed terminology may help decision makers interpret review findings.

The COMET website provides a database of core outcome sets agreed or in development. Some Cochrane Groups have developed their own outcome sets. While the availability of outcome sets and taxonomies varies across clinical areas, several taxonomies exist for specifying broad outcome domains (e.g. Dodd et al., 2018, LHOM, 2018).

3. Define the outcome time points.

A key attribute of defining an outcome is specifying the time of measurement. In reviews, time frames, and not specific time points, are often specified to handle the likely diversity in timing of outcome measurement across studies (e.g. a'medium-term' time frame might be defined as including outcomes measured between 6 and 12 months).

In specifying outcome timing:

* focus on 'clinically meaningful' time points (e.g. considering the course of the condition over time and duration of the intervention may determine whether

In a review of combined diet and exercise for preventing gestational diabetes mellitus, a core outcome set by the Cochrane Pregnancy and childbirth group was used (Shepherd et al., 2017).

In a review of decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions (Stacey et al., 2017), outcome domains were based on criteria for evaluating decision aids agreed in the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (UPDDS). Doing so helped to assess the use of aids across diverse clinical decisions.

The Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group has an agreed taxonomy to guide specification of outcomes of importance in evaluating communication interventions (Cochrane Consumers & Communication Group).

In a review of psychological therapies for panic disorder, the main outcomes were'short-term' (\(\leqslant\)6 months from treatment commencement). 'Long-term' outcomes (\(>\)6 months from treatment commencement) were considered important, but not specified as critical because of concerns of participant attrition (Pompeli et al., 2018).

In contrast, in a review of antidepressants, a clinically meaningful time frame of 6 to 12 months might be specified for the critical outcome 'depression', since this is the recommended treatment duration. However, it may be anticipated that many studies will be of shorter

* for self-reported measures, items that cover the outcome/domain and are developed using theory, empirical evidence and consumer involvement.

Measures may be identified from core outcome sets (e.g. Williamson et al. 2017, KICMN 2018) or systematic reviews of instruments (see Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) initiative for a database of examples).

For a particular domain, multiple outcomes within a study may be available for inclusion. This may arise from:

* multiple outcomes measured within a domain (e.g. "anxiety" and "depression" in a mental health" domain);
* multiple methods to measure the outcome (e.g. self-reported depression, clinician-rated depression), or tools/instruments (e.g. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, lack Depression Inventory), as well as their subscales;
* multiple time points measured within a time frame.

Effects of the intervention calculated from these different sources of multiplicity are statistically dependent, since they have been calculated using the same participants.

To deal with this dependency, select only one outcome per study for a particular comparison, or use a meta-analysis method that accounts for the dependency (see Step 6).

Pre-specify the method of selection from multiple outcomes or measures in the protocol, using an approach that is independent of the result (see Chapter 9, Table 9.3.c) (Lopez-Lopez et al. 2018). Document all eligible outcomes or measures in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table, noting which was selected and why.

The following hierarchy was specified to select one outcome per domain in a review examining the effects of portion, package or tableware size (Hollands et al. 2015):

* the study's primary outcome;
* the outcome that was most proximal to the health outcome in the context of the specific intervention;
* the outcome that provided the largest-scale measure of the domain (e.g. total amount of food consumed selected ahead of amount of vegetables consumed).

Selection of the outcome was made blinded to the results. All available outcome measures were documented in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.

In a review of audit and feedback for healthcare providers, the outcome domains were 'provider performance' (e.g. compliance with recommended use of a laboratory test) and 'patient health outcomes' (e.g. smoking status, blood pressure) (Ivers et al. 2012). For each domain, outcomes were selected using the following hierarchy:

* the study's primary outcome;
* the outcome used in the sample size calculation; and
* the outcome with the median effect.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \hline \hline Step & Considerations & Examples \\ \hline \hline Multiplicity can arise from the reporting of multiple analyses of the same outcome (e.g. analyses that do and do not adjust for prognostic factors; intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses) and multiple reports of the same study (e.g. journal articles, conference abstracts). Approaches for dealing with this type of multiplicity should also be specified in the protocol (López- López et al., 2018). & It may be difficult to anticipate all forms of multiplicity when developing a protocol.

can lead to difficulties in interpretation and an increase in the type | error rate (Bender et al 2008, Lopez-Lopez et al 2018).
* Include all the available effect estimates, using a meta-analysis method that models or accounts for the dependency. This option has the advantage of using all information which may lead to greater precision in estimating the intervention effects (Lopez-Lopez et al 2018). Options include multivariate meta-analysis (Murrids and Salanti 2013), multilevel models (Konstantopoulos 2011) or robust variance estimation (Hedges et al 2010) (see Lopez-Lopez et al 2018 for further discussion).

Consider building in flexibility to group outcomes at different levels or time intervals. Inflexible approaches can undermine the potential to synthesize, especially when few studies are anticipated, or there is likely to be diversity in the way outcomes are defined and measured and the timing of measurement. If insufficient studies report data for meaningful synthesis using the narrower domains, the broader domains can be used (see also Chapter 2, Section 2.5.3).

Consider a hypothetical review aiming to examine the effects of behavioural psychological interventions for the treatment of overweight and obese adults. A specific outcome is body mass index [BMI]. However, also specifying a broader outcome domain 'indicator of body mass' will facilitate synthesis in the circumstance where few studies report BMI, but most report an indicator of body mass (such as weight or waist circumference). This is particularly important when few studies may be anticipated or there is expected diversity in the measurement methods or tools.

**MECIR Box 3.3.a Relevant expectations for conduct of intervention reviews**

**C9: Predefining study designs (**Mandatory**)

_Define in advance the eligibility criteria for study designs in a clear and unambiguous way, with a focus on features of a study's design rather than design labels._

Predefined, unambiguous eligibility criteria are a fundamental prerequisite for a systematic review. This is particularly important when non-randomized studies are considered. Some labels commonly used to define study designs can be ambiguous. For example a 'double blind' study may not make it clear who was blinded; a 'case-control' study may be nested within a cohort, or be undertaken in a cross-sectional manner; or a 'prospective' study may have only some features defined or undertaken prospectively.

**C11:** Justifying choice of study designs (**Mandatory**)

_Justify the choice of eligible study designs._

It might be difficult to address some interventions or some outcomes in randomized trials. Authors should be able to justify why they have chosen either to restrict the review to randomized trials or to include non-randomized studies. The particular study designs included should be justified with regard to appropriateness to the review question and with regard to potential for bias.

**MECIR Box 3.3.b Relevant expectations for conduct of intervention reviews**

_C10:_ Including randomized trials (**Mandatory**)

_Include randomized trials as eligible for inclusion in the review, if it is feasible to conduct them to evaluate the interventions and outcomes of interest._

Randomized trials are the best study design for evaluating the efficacy of interventions. If it is feasible to conduct them to evaluate questions that are being addressed by the review, they must be considered eligible for the review. However, appropriate exclusion criteria may be put in place, for example regarding length of follow-up.

suggests that, on average, non-randomized studies produce effect estimates that indicate more extreme benefits of the effects of health care than randomized trials. However, the extent, and even the direction, of the bias is difficult to predict. These issues are discussed at length in Chapter 24, which provides guidance on when it might be appropriate to include non-randomized studies in a Cochrane Review.

Practical considerations also motivate the restriction of many Cochrane Reviews to randomized trials. In recent decades there has been considerable investment internationally in establishing infrastructure to index and identify randomized trials. Cochrane has contributed to these efforts, including building up and maintaining a database of randomized trials, developing search filters to aid their identification, working with MEDLINE to improve tagging and identification of randomized trials, and using machine learning and crowdsourcing to reduce author workload in identifying randomized trials (Chapter 4, Section 4.6.6.2). The same scale of organizational investment has not (yet) been matched for the identification of other types of studies. Consequently, identifying and including other types of studies may require additional efforts to identify studies and to keep the review up to date, and might increase the risk that the result of the review will be influenced by publication bias. This issue and other bias-related issues that are important to consider when defining types of studies are discussed in detail in Chapters 7 and 13.

Specific aspects of study design and conduct should be considered when defining eligibility criteria, even if the review is restricted to randomized trials. For example, whether cluster-randomized trials (Chapter 23, Section 23.1) and crossover trials (Chapter 23, Section 23.2) are eligible, as well as other criteria for eligibility such as use of a placebo comparison group, evaluation of outcomes blinded to allocation sequence, or a minimum period of follow-up. There will always be a trade-off between restrictive study design criteria (which might result in the inclusion of studies that are at low risk of bias, but very few in number) and more liberal design criteria (which might result in the inclusion of more studies, but at a higher risk of bias). Furthermore, excessively broad criteria might result in the inclusion of misleading evidence. If, for example, interest focuses on whether a therapy improves survival in patients with a chronic condition, it might be inappropriate to look at studies of very short duration, except to make explicit the point that they cannot address the question of interest.

#### 3.3.2 Including non-randomized studies

The decision of whether non-randomized studies (and what type) will be included is decided alongside the formulation of the review PICO. The main drivers that may lead to the inclusion of non-randomized studies include: (i) when randomized trials are unable to address the effects of the intervention on harm and long-term outcomes or in specific populations or settings; or (ii) for interventions that cannot be randomized (e.g. policy change introduced in a single or small number of jurisdictions) (see Chapter 24). Cochrane, in collaboration with others, has developed guidance for review authors to support their decision about when to look for and include non-randomized studies (Schunemann et al 2013).

Non-randomized designs have the commonality of not using randomization to allocate units to comparison groups, but their different design features mean that they are variable in their susceptibility to bias. Eligibility criteria should be based on explicit study design features, and not the study labels applied by the primary researchers (e.g. case-control, cohort), which are often used inconsistently [14, see Chapter 24].

When non-randomized studies are included, review authors should consider how the studies will be grouped and used in the synthesis. The Cochrane Non-randomized Studies Methods Group taxonomy of design features (see Chapter 24) may provide a basis for grouping together studies that are expected to have similar inferential strength and for providing a consistent language for describing the study design.

Once decisions have been made about grouping study designs, planning of how these will be used in the synthesis is required. Review authors need to decide whether it is useful to synthesize results from non-randomized studies and, if so, whether results from randomized trials and non-randomized studies should be included in the same synthesis (for the purpose of examining whether study design explains heterogeneity among the intervention effects), or whether the effects should be synthesized in separate comparisons [13]. Decisions should be made for each of the different types of non-randomized studies under consideration. Review authors might anticipate increased heterogeneity when non-randomized studies are synthesized, and adoption of a meta-analysis model that encompasses heterogeneity is wise [13] (such as a random effects model, see Chapter 10, Section 10.10.4). For further discussion of non-randomized studies, see Chapter 24.

### 3.4 Eligibility based on publication status and language

Chapter 4 contains detailed guidance on how to identify studies from a range of sources including, but not limited to, those in peer-reviewed journals. In general, a strategy to include studies reported in all types of publication will reduce bias (Chapter 7). There would need to be a compelling argument for the exclusion of studies on the basis of their publication status (MECIR Box 3.4.a), including unpublished studies, partially published studies, and studies published in 'grey' literature sources. Given the additional challenge in obtaining unpublished studies, it is possible that any unpublished studies identified in a given review may be an unrepresentative subset of all the unpublished studies in existence. However, the bias this introduces is of less concern than the bias introduced by excluding all unpublished studies, given what is known about the impact of reporting biases (see Chapter 13 on bias due to missing studies, and Chapter 4, Section 4.3 for a more detailed discussion of searching for unpublished and grey literature).

Likewise, while searching for, and analysing, studies in any language can be extremely resource-intensive, review authors should consider carefully the implications for bias (and equity, see Chapter 16) if they restrict eligible studies to those published in one specific language (usually English). See Chapter 4 (Section 4.4.5) for further discussion of language and other restrictions while searching.

### 4.1 Introduction

Cochrane Reviews take a systematic and comprehensive approach to identifying studies that meet the eligibility criteria for the review. This chapter outlines some general issues in searching for studies; describes the main sources of potential studies; and discusses how to plan the search process, design and carry out search strategies, manage references found during the search process, correctly document the search process and select studies from the search results.

This chapter aims to provide review authors with background information on all aspects of searching for studies so that they can better understand the search process. All authors of systematic reviews should, however, identify an experienced medical/healthcare librarian or information specialist to provide support for the search process. The chapter also aims to provide advice and guidance for medical/healthcare librarians and information specialists (within and beyond Cochrane) involved in the search process to identify studies for inclusion in systematic reviews.

This chapter focuses on searching for randomized trials. Many of the search principles discussed, however, will also apply to other study designs. Considerations for searching for non-randomized studies are discussed in Chapter 24 (see also Chapter 19 when these are specifically for adverse effects). Other discussion of searching for specific types of evidence appears in chapters dedicated to these types of evidence, such as Chapter 17 on complex and public health interventions, Chapter 20 on economics evidence and Chapter 21 on qualitative research.

An online Technical Supplement to this chapter provides more detail on searching methods and is available from Cochrane Training.

### 4.2 General issues

#### 4.2.1 Role of the information specialist/librarian

Medical/healthcare librarians and information specialists have an integral role in the production of Cochrane Reviews. There is increasing evidence to support the involvement of an information specialist in the review to improve the quality of various aspects of the search process (Rethlefsen et al 2015, Meert et al 2016, Metzendorf 2016).

Most Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs) employ an information specialist to support authors. The range of services, however, offered by CRGs and/or their information specialists varies according to the resources available. Cochrane Review authors should, therefore, contact their Cochrane Information Specialist at the earliest stage to find out what advice and support is available to them. Authors conducting their own searches should seek advice from their Cochrane Information Specialist not only on which sources to search, but also with respect to the exact strategies to be run (see Section 4.4). If the CRG does not provide this service or employ an information specialist, we recommend that review authors seek guidance from a medical/healthcare librarian or information specialist, preferably one with experience in supporting systematic reviews.

Cochrane Information Specialists are responsible for providing assistance to authors with searching for studies for inclusion in their reviews, and for keeping up to date with Cochrane methodological developments in information retrieval (Littlewood et al 2017).

A key element of the role is the maintenance of a Specialized Register for their Review Group, containing reports of trials relating to the group's scope. Within the limits of licensing restrictions, the content of these group registers is shared with users worldwide via the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of the Cochrane Library (see Section 4.3.3).

Most CRGs offer support to authors in study identification from the early planning stage to the final write-up of the review, and the support available may include some or all of the following:

* advising authors on which databases and other sources to search;
* designing, or providing guidance on designing, search strategies for the main bibliographic databases and/or trials registers;
* running searches in databases and/or registers available to the information specialist;
* saving and collating search results, and sharing them with authors in appropriate formats;
* advising authors on how to run searches in other sources and how to download results;
* drafting, or assisting authors in drafting, the search methods sections of a Cochrane Protocol and Review and/or Update;
* ensuring that Cochrane Protocols, Reviews and Updates meet the requirements set out in the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) relating to searching activities for reviews;
* organizing translations, or at least data extraction, of papers where required to enable authors to assess papers for inclusion/exclusion in their reviews;
* obtaining copies of trial reports for review teams when required (within copyright legislation);
* providing advice and support to author teams on the use of reference management tools, and other software used in review production, including review production tools such as RevMan, Covidence and EPPI-Reviewer; and
* checking and formatting the references to included and/or excluded studies in line with the Cochrane Style Manual.

The Cochrane Information Specialists' Handbook (Chapter 6, Author support) contains further information about how Cochrane Information Specialists can support authors (Littlewood et al 2017).

#### 4.2.2 Minimizing bias

Systematic reviews require a thorough, objective and reproducible search of a range of sources to identify as many eligible studies as possible (within resource limits). This is a major factor distinguishing systematic reviews from traditional narrative reviews, which helps to minimize bias and achieve more reliable estimates of effects and uncertainties. A search of MEDLINE alone is not considered adequate. Research evidence indicates that not all known published randomized trials are available in MEDLINE and that even if relevant records are in MEDLINE, it can be difficult to retrieve them (see Section 4.3.2).

Going beyond MEDLINE is important not only for ensuring that as many relevant studies as possible are identified, but also to minimize selection bias for those that are found. Relying exclusively on a MEDLINE search may retrieve a set of reports unrepresentative of all reports that would have been identified through a wider or more extensive search of several sources.

Time and budget restraints require the review team to balance the thoroughness of the search with efficiency in the use of time and funds. The best way of achieving this balance is to be aware of, and try to minimize, the biases such as publication bias and language bias that can result from restricting searches in different ways (see Chapters 8 and 13 for further guidance on assessing these biases). Unlike for tasks such as study selection or data extraction, it is not considered necessary (or even desirable) for two people to conduct independent searches in parallel. It is strongly recommended, however, that all search strategies should be peer reviewed by a suitably qualified and experienced medical/healthcare librarian or information specialist (see Section 4.4.8).

#### 4.2.3 Studies versus reports of studies

Systematic reviews have studies as the primary units of interest and analysis. A single study may have more than one report about it, and each of these reports may contribute useful information for the review (see Section 4.6.1). For most of the sources listed in Section 4.3, the search process will retrieve individual reports of studies, so that multiple reports of the same study will need to be identified and associated with each other manually by the review authors. There is, however, an increasing number of _study-based_ sources, which link multiple records of the same study together, such as the Cochrane Register of Studies and the Specialized Registers of a number of CRGs and Fields (see online Technical Supplement), and some other trials registers and regulatory and industry sources. Processes and software to select and group publications by study are discussed in Section 4.6.

#### 4.2.4 Copyright and licensing

It is Cochrane policy that all review authors and others involved in Cochrane should adhere to copyright legislation and the terms of database licensing agreements. With respect to searching for studies, this refers in particular to adhering to the terms and conditions of use when searching databases and other sources and downloading records, as well as adhering to copyright legislation when obtaining copies of publications. Review authors should seek guidance on this from their medical/healthcare librarian or information specialist, as copyright legislation varies across jurisdictions and licensing agreements vary across organizations.

### Sources to search

#### 4.3.1 Bibliographic databases

##### 4.3.1.1 Introduction to bibliographic databases

The search for studies in a Cochrane Review should be as extensive as possible in order to reduce the risk of reporting bias and to identify as much relevant evidence as possible (see MECIR Box 4.3.a). Searches of health-related bibliographic databases are 

#### 4.3 Sources to search

##### 4.3.1 Relevant expectations for conduct of intervention reviews

##### 4.3.2 Planning the search (**Mandatory**)

_Plan in advance the methods to be used for identifying studies. Design searches to capture as many studies as possible that meet the eligibility criteria, ensuring that relevant time periods and sources are covered and not restricted by language or publication status._

Searches should be motivated directly by the eligibility criteria for the review, and it is important that all types of eligible studies are considered when planning the search. If searches are restricted by publication status or by language of publication, there is a possibility of publication bias, or language bias (whereby the language of publication is selected in a way that depends on the findings of the study), or both. Removing language restrictions in English language databases is not a good substitute for searching non-English language journals and databases.

3.3 Searches for studies should be as extensive as possible in order to reduce the risk of publication bias and to identify as much relevant evidence as possible. The minimum databases to be covered are the CRG's Specialized Register (if it exists and was designed to support reviews in this way), CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (if Embase is available to either the CRG or the review author). Expertise may be required to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. Some, but not all, reports of eligible studies from MEDLINE, Embase and the CRGs' Specialized Registers are already included in CENTRAL.

generally the most efficient way to identify an initial set of relevant reports of studies (EUnetHTA 2017). Database selection should be guided by the review topic (Suarez-Almazor et al 2000, Stevenson and Lawlor 2004, Lorenzetti et al 2014). When topics are specialized, cross-disciplinary, or involve emerging technologies (Rice et al 2016), additional databases may need to be identified and searched (Wallace et al 1997, Stevenson and Lawlor 2004).

The three bibliographic databases generally considered to be the most important sources to search for reports of trials are CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Halladay et al 2015,Sampson et al 2016) and Embase (Woods and Trewheellar 1998, Sampson et al 2003, Bai et al 2007). These databases are described in more detail in Sections 4.3.1.2 and 4.3.1.3 and in the online Technical Supplement. For Cochrane Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (if access to Embase is available to the review team) should be searched (see MECIR Box 4.3.a). These searches may be undertaken specifically for the review, or indirectly by searching the CRG's Specialized Register.

Some bibliographic databases, such as MEDLINE and Embase, include abstracts for the majority of recent records. A key advantage of such databases is that they can be searched electronically both for words in the title or abstract and by using the standardized indexing terms, or controlled vocabulary, assigned to each record (see Section 4.3.1.2). Cochrane has developed a database of reports of randomized trials called the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which is published within the Cochrane Library (see Section 4.3.1.3).

Bibliographic databases are available to individuals for a fee (by subscription or on a 'pay-as-you-go' basis) or free at the point of use. They may be available through national provisions, site-wide licences at institutions such as universities or hospitals, through professional organizations as part of their membership packages or free-of-charge on the internet. Some international initiatives provide free or low-cost online access to databases (and full-text journals) over the internet. The Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative (HINARI) programme, set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) together with major publishers, provides access to a wide range of databases including the Cochrane Library for healthcare professionals in local, not-for-profit institutions in more than 115 countries, areas and territories. The International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP) also provides access to a wide range of databases (and journals) including the Cochrane Library. Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL) is a similar initiative based on library consortia to support affordable licensing of journals and other sources in more than 60 low-income and transition countries in central, eastern and south-east Europe, the former Soviet Union, Africa, the Middle East and South-east Asia.

The online Technical Supplement provides more detailed information about how to search these sources and other databases. It also provides a list of general healthcare databases by region and healthcare databases by subject area. Further evidence-based information about sources to search can be found on the SuRe Info portal, which is updated twice per year.

MEDLINE and EmbaseCochrane Reviews of interventions should include a search of MEDLINE (see MECIR Box 4.3.a). MEDLINE (as of August 2018) contains over 25 million references to journal articles in biomedicine and health from 1946 onwards. More than 5200 journals in about 40 languages are indexed for MEDLINE (US National Library of Medicine 2019).

PubMed provides access to a free version of MEDLINE that also includes up-to-date citations not yet indexed for MEDLINE (US National Library of Medicine 2018). Additionally, PubMed includes records from journals that are not indexed for MEDLINE and records considered 'out-of-scope' from journals that are partially indexed for MEDLINE (US National Library of Medicine no date).

MEDLINE is also available on subscription from a number of other database vendors, such as EBSCO, Ovid, ProQuest and STN. Access is usually 'free at-the-point-of-use' to members of the institutions paying the subscriptions (e.g. hospitals and universities). Ovid MEDLINE (segment name'medall') covers all of the available content and meta-data in PubMed with a delay of one day (except during the annual cloud, at the end of each year, when Ovid MEDLINE will not match the PubMed baseline). Aside from the MEDLINE records, Ovid includes all content types available in PubMed including; Epub Ahead of Print, PubMed-not-MEDLINE, In-process citations and citations for books available on the NCBI Bookshelf.

When searching MEDLINE via service providers or interfaces other than Ovid or PubMed, we recommend verification of the exact coverage of the database in relation to PubMed, where no explicit information on this is readily available.

Cochrane Reviews of interventions should include a search of Embase (if access to Embase is available to the review team) (see MECIR Box 4.3.a). Embase (as of June 2018) contains over 30 million records from more than 8000 currently published journals. Embase now includes all MEDLINE records, thus, technically, allowing both databases to be searched simultaneously. Further details on the implications of this for searching are available in the online Technical Supplement. There are more than 6 million records in Embase, from more than 2900 journals that are not indexed in MEDLINE (Elsevier 2016a). Embase includes articles from about 90 countries. Embase Classic provides access to almost 2 million records digitized from the Excerpta Medica print journals (the original print indexes from which Embase was created) from 1947 to 1973 (Elsevier 2016b).

Embase is only available by subscription, either directly via Elsevier (as Embase.com) or from other database vendors, such as Ovid, ProQuest or STN. It is mandatory for Cochrane intervention reviews to include a search of Embase if access is available to the review team (see MECIR Box 4.3.a). Note that Embase is searched regularly by Cochrane for reports of trials. These records are included in CENTRAL (see online Technical Supplement).

The online Technical Supplement provides guidance on how to search MEDLINE and Embase for reports of trials. The actual degree of reference overlap between MEDLINE and Embase varies widely according to the topic, but studies comparing searches of the two databases have generally concluded that a comprehensive search requires that both databases be searched (Lefebvre et al 2008) (see MECIR Box 4.3.a).

Conversely, two recent studies examined different samples of Cochrane Reviews and identified the databases from which the included studies of these reviews originated (Halladay et al 2015, Hartling et al 2016). Halladay showed that the majority of included studies could be identified via PubMed (range 75% to 92%) and Hartling showed that the majority of included studies could be identified by using a combination of two databases, but the two databases were different in each case. Both studies, one across all healthcare areas (Halladay et al 2015) and the other on child health (Hartling et al 2016), report a minimal extent to which the inclusion of studies not indexed in PubMed altered the meta-analyses. Hence, the current recommendation of searching multiple databases needs to be evaluated further, so as to confirm under which circumstances more comprehensive searches of multiple databases is warranted.

#### 4.3.1.3 The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)

Since its inception, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) has been recognized as the most comprehensive source of reports of randomized trials (Egger and Smith 1998). CENTRAL is published as part of the Cochrane Library and is updated monthly. As of June 2018, CENTRAL contains over 1,275,000 records of reports of trials/trials registry records potentially eligible for inclusion in Cochrane Reviews, by far the majority of which are randomized trials.

Many of the records in CENTRAL have been identified through systematic searches of MEDLINE and Embase (see online Technical Supplement). CENTRAL, however, also includes citations to reports of randomized trials that are not indexed in MEDLINE, Embase or other bibliographic databases; citations published in many languages; and citations that are available only in conference proceedings or other sources that are difficult to access. It also includes records from trials registers and trials results registers.

These additional records are, for the most part, identified by Cochrane Information Specialists, many of whom conduct comprehensive searches to populate CRG Specialized Registers, collecting records of trials eligible for Cochrane Reviews in their field. These Specialized Registers are included in CENTRAL. Where a Specialized Register is available, for which sufficiently comprehensive searching has been conducted, a search of the Specialized Register may be conducted instead of separately searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase for a specific review. In these cases, the search will be more precise, but an equivalent number of included studies will be identified with lower numbers of records to screen. There will, however, be a time-lag between records appearing in databases such as MEDLINE or Embase and their inclusion in a Specialized Register.

CENTRAL is available through the Cochrane Library. Many review authors have access free-of-charge at the point-of-use through national provisions and other similar arrangements, or as part of a paid subscription to the Cochrane Library. All Cochrane Information Specialists have access to CENTRAL.

The online Technical Supplement provides information on what is in CENTRAL from MEDLINE, Embase and other sources, as well as guidance on searching CENTRAL.

#### 4.3.1.4 Other bibliographic databases

Many countries and regions produce bibliographic databases that focus on the literature produced in those regions and which often include journals and other literature not indexed elsewhere. There are also subject-specific bibliographic databases, such as AMED (alternative therapies), CINAHL (nursing and allied health) and PsycINFO (psychology and psychiatry). It is highly desirable that searches be conducted of appropriate national, regional and subject specific bibliographic databases (see MECIR Box 4.3.b). Further details are provided in the online Technical Supplement.

Citation indexes are bibliographic databases that record instances where a particular reference is cited, in addition to the standard bibliographic content. Citation indexes can be used to identify studies that are similar to a study report of interest, as it is probable that other reports citing or cited by a study will contain similar or related content.

#### 4.3.2 Ongoing studies and unpublished data sources

Initiatives to provide access to ongoing studies and unpublished data constitute a fast-moving field (Isojarvi et al 2018). Review authors should therefore consult their medical/healthcare librarian or information specialist for current advice.

It is important to identify ongoing studies, so that when a review is updated these can be assessed for possible inclusion. Awareness of the existence of a possibly relevant ongoing study and its expected completion date might affect not only decisions with respect to when to update a specific review, but also when to aim to complete a review. Information about possibly relevant ongoing studies should be included in the review in the 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' table.

Even when studies are completed, some are never published. An association between'statistically significant' results and publication has been documented across a number of studies, as summarized in Chapter 13. Finding out about unpublished studies, and including their results in a systematic review when eligible and appropriate (Cook et al 1993), is important for minimizing bias. Several studies and other articles addressing issues around identifying unpublished studies have been published (Easterbrook et al 1991, Weber et al 1998, Manheimer and Anderson 2002, MacLean et al 2003, Lee et al 2008, Chan 2012, Bero 2013, Schroll et al 2013, Chapman et al 2014, Kreis et al 2014, Scherer et al 2015, Hwang et al 2016, Lampert et al 2016).

There is no easy and reliable single way to obtain information about studies that have been completed but never published. There have, however, been several important initiatives resulting in better access to studies and their results from sources other than the main bibliographic databases and journals. These include trials registers and trials results registers (see Section 4.3.3), regulatory agency sources and clinical study reports (CSRs); (the very detailed reports prepared by industry for regulatory approval) (see Section 4.3.4). A recent study (Halfpenny et al 2016) assessed the value and usability for systematic reviews and network meta-analyses of data from trials registers, CSRs and regulatory authorities, and concluded that data from these sources have the potential to influence systematic review results. Two earlier studies showed that a considerably higher proportion of CSRs prepared for regulatoryapproval of drugs provided complete information on study methods and results than did trials register records or journal publications (Wieseler et al 2012) and that conventional, publicly available sources (European Public Assessment Reports, journal publications, and trials register records) provide insufficient information on new drugs, especially on patient relevant outcomes in approved subpopulations (Kohler et al 2015).

A Cochrane Methodology Review examined studies assessing methods for obtaining unpublished data and concluded that those carrying out systematic reviews should continue to contact authors for missing data and that email contact was more successful than other methods (Young and Hopewell 2011). An annotated bibliography of published studies addressing searching for unpublished studies and obtaining access to unpublished data is also available (Arber et al 2013). One particular study focused on the contribution of unpublished studies, including dissertations, and studies in languages other than English, to the results of meta-analyses in reviews relevant to children (Hartling et al 2017). They found that, in their sample, unpublished studies and studies in languages other than English rarely had any impact on the results and conclusions of the review. They did, however, concede that inclusion of these study types may have an impact in situations where there are few relevant studies, or where there are 'questionable vested interests' in the published literature.

Correspondence can be an important source of information about unpublished studies. It is highly desirable for authors of Cochrane Reviews of interventions to contact relevant individuals and organizations for information about unpublished or ongoing studies (see MECIR Box 4.3.c). Letters of request for information can be used to identify completed but unpublished studies. One way of doing this is to send a comprehensive list of relevant articles along with the eligibility criteria for the review to the first author of reports of included studies, asking if they know of any additional studies (ongoing or completed; published or unpublished) that might be relevant. This approach may be especially useful in areas where there are few trials or a limited number of active research groups. It may also be desirable to send the same letter to other experts and pharmaceutical companies or others with an interest in the area. Some review teams set up websites for systematic review projects, listing the studies identified to date and inviting submission of information on studies not already listed.

[backgroundcolor=gray!20, linecolor=gray!Asking researchers for information about completed but never published studies has not always been found to be fruitful (Hetherington et al 1989, Horton 1997) though some researchers have reported that this is an important method for retrieving studies for systematic reviews (Royle and Milne 2003, Greenhalgh and Peacock 2005, Reveiz et al 2006). The R1AT (Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials) initiative (Doshi et al 2013) aims to address these problems by offering a methodology that allows others to re-publish mis-reported and to publish unreported trials. Anyone who can access the trial data and document trial abandonment can use this methodology. The R1AT Support Centre offers free-of-charge support and competitive funding to researchers interested in this approach. It has been suggested that legislation such as Freedom of Information Acts in various countries might be used to gain access to information about unpublished trials (Bennett and Jull 2003, MacLean et al 2003).

#### 4.3.3 Trials registers and trials results registers

A recent study suggested that trials registers are an important source for identifying additional randomized trials (Baudard et al 2017). Cochrane Reviews of interventions should search relevant trials registers and repositories of results (see MECIR Box 4.3.d). Although there are many other trials registers, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal (Pansieri et al 2017) are considered to be the most important for searching to identify studies for a systematic review. Research has shown that even though ClinicalTrials.gov is included in the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, not all ClinicalTrials.gov records can be successfully retrieved via searches of the ICTRP Search Portal (Glanville et al 2014, Knelangen et al 2018). Therefore, it is not sufficient to search the ICTRP alone. Guidance for searching these and other trials registers is provided in the online Technical Supplement.

In addition to Cochrane, other organizations such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2014) and the US Institute of Medicine (Institute of Medicine 2011) also advocate searching trials registers.
